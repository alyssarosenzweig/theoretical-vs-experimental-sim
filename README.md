TEPS
======

TEPS (Theoretical versus Experimental Probability Simulator) is a simple webapp for experimenting with probability, primarily useful for Pre-algebra Algebra I students, especially students with an understanding of Computer Science. TEPS, at its most basic usage, demonstrates the distinction between experimental and theoretical probability (as the name implies); however, it can also be used for experimentation with arbitrary probability functions through "complex" components.
